					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> I am a current Australian resident however i was born and raised in Lahore,Pakistan until the age of 12 when i moved to Australia. Education wise I’ve successfully completed year 12 and i am currently enrolled in Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. The languages i speak include: English, Urdu, Hindi and a bit of Punjabi. Now for the interesting fact about my self: Well to sum it up-My family nearly had to go through my death when i portrayed symptoms of “Death Rattle” trying to fight Dengue Fever (Fortunately i survived, not sure if my family feels the same way). My favourite sports are categorised in order as Cricket on top and basketball and soccer plus table tennis to follow.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Having been playing games for nearly all of my life, I have wanted to join the I.T field since the age of 12. Watching the world, especially Tv’s revolution in front of me, has fascinated me. Going from having to use a bresom to manually clean your floor to having some A.I powered vacuum to do it for you with just a click on your phone or even voice automation surprised me. It wasn't until I had come to Australia that I decided Machine Learning/A.I was the field for me. Also having a particular interest in software engineering, I am certain that this is the path I'll take for a better future. Being an asian you're kind of hypnotized in a way to follow a career from either the Medical or Engineering field. Any other field is regarded as “lower” in many Asian, especially south asian countries. I myself experienced this same issue where my mum had wanted me to be a doctor, however I lacked the ability to just throw away my life just to earn top dollar. My dad on the other hand, having been a HR Manager, always told me to choose a path that not only would earn you a decent amount but also one that has a high growth chance in the future. Him having studied human behavior and all its aspects he has nurtured me alot in regards to work and its environments. It wasn’t until recently that my mum had realized that her kid won't be a doctor, however she still seems to occasionally remind me that I could have been one. I currently lack experience however i have created websites in the past and even made a flappy bird prototype in year 12. Doing this course, I aim to enhance my growth and gain more experience. Why i chose to come to RMIT? I was stuck between choosing RMIT or Monash, however after going through the curriculum and course overview I chose RMIT. I even discussed it with my secondary school teachers and they had suggested that I choose RMIT. The word “Artificial Intelligence” on the course website was more than enough to attract me to this course. As I stated previously, this is the field I was interested in. Although Monash also offered A.I, it required Math Methods in Year 12 which I did not do. Furthermore I'm expecting to learn handson experience that could easily lead me to a path in the future. I am expecting to learn various fields of I.T and how they interact with each other on a daily basis. Not only that, I also expect to learn how I.T could pave the way for a more optimistic future.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Job Title</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>As I stated above, having always been interested in A.I, I find that Machine Learning is the perfect job for me. To me the roles and responsibilities include : Performing statistical analysis, collaborate with a bunch of other fields in order to conclude or form a group project beneficial for organizations of both fields (Unless both are under 1 organization), building ML systems (Providing a technique, model or any sort of algorithm that assists the computer systems ability to learn and adapt), work with stakeholders that could potentially boost not only your personal but also the company’s growth.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Currently I have the ability of understanding and writing amateur codes in Visual Basic, being able to create websites, understanding and writing intermediate python, Adobe photoshop. Currently the only qualification i have is the completion of year 12 however i have been awarded with the best academic performance in year 12 for Data Analytics. I also have the ability to make apps/games with Intellij.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>As it states in the job description, I'll definitely need python as well as SQL (alot of it apparently).  I will also need 3+ years of experience in either DevOps/Cloud or MLOps engineering. Not only that, I will also be needing some sort of commercial experience with Machine Learning Systems. Furthermore, the company asks for its employees to be able to constantly learn and adapt to any upcoming changes to the industry/framework.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>I plan to gain these by first completing my Uni Course (Bachelor Of Information Technology), after that or even between it I plan to gain an internship with an amateur A.I based organization. This internship potentially could boost some sort of growth towards achieving my dream. As I already have some experience in python, learning top tier python won't be easy but also won't be heard. For SQL, I'll most likely do an online course at the same time as I'm working as an intern.</p>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>According to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator test, my strengths include: Reliable, receptive, passionate, altruistic, charismatic. Other traits include - know how others are feeling just by looking at them, believe in karma, actively volunteer, defend someone who is being bullied, consider themselves spiritual. </p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>My weakness according to the test include: Condescending, intense, empathetic, pragmatic which i somewhat agree with. By somewhat i mean that i dont think i am fully pragmatic, for example at sometimes pragmatism is a way better to approach to take then optimism.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>Often push themselves to prove their merit and make a good impression on their managers. Perceptive and dedicated, people with this personality type can take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer. I completely agree with these team composition traits as i know myself to be inheriting these. Overall i dont think the test results would really make me much different from a team however i may prefer to regard as myself as the main leader/project manager due to these traits.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has put surface disinfectants to the test. It has also prompted organizations to develop ultraviolet-disinfection or otherwise known as UV-C robots. These robots are becoming more popular as an option for disinfecting rooms and spaces of all surfaces in one process, and as a result, they appear to be appealing to hospital administrators. This is what I have decided for my project to be as not only is it useful but also less costly then typical manpower. Furthermore according to R&D, UVC Robots improve sanitisation by 60% compared to liquid based cleaning.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This project to me is very useful as first of all, it would give me some experience of the key skills required for my dream job. Not only this but as stated above it would also fill the desires of my mum as i technically am working in the hospital. The main motivation behind this however is the need to do something for people. This is a genuine and sad fact that people mostly go to hospital as a way of obtaining medicine or treatment for their illness. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are complications of healthcare and linked with high morbidity and mortality. Each year, about 1 in 25 U.S. hospital patients is diagnosed with at least one infection related to hospital care alone. 1 in 25 !!! Can you believe this? For those who even go to a hospital or even a medical clinic for just a regular checkup could come back contracted with the worst of bacteria/infections. Some of the most common infections people transmit across medical clinics include but are not limited to : UTI, pneumonia and even lung infections. The need to help stop this due to lack of staff or lack of care provided, I feel that UV-C robots are the perfect way to transform our hospitals in the future if we genuinely want to save lives. </p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The robot moves automatically in a defined area, after being programmed for things like  time and distance from surfaces. It is made up of multiple lamps placed on top of a platform. During disinfection, the Robots emit UV-C irradiation at a wavelength of around 200-300 nanometres, allowing for  a  full 360 degree coverage. During the disinfection process, the robot moves at a steady speed, achieving a coverage of areas at a distance of several meters. However, in order to enable auto moving, the robot must be programmed via the use of a detailed map/blueprint of the hospital or medical clinic. Once every aspect is set, furniture and all other objects must remain in exactly the same place to enable an autonomous functioning. Currently, according to my idea and also for safety, this UV-C robot automatically shuts off when its motion sensor detects any moving things (whether it's a human or a vase falling down)  during the disinfection process. Despite the ultimate  recommendations, manual cleaning in each hospital is based mostly on local protocol and cleaning staff’s personal opinions, as well as the control and the inspection of their performance. Evidence further suggests that manual cleaning and disinfection are often inadequate and result in  contamination (which we know to be true). Besides killing microorganisms on surfaces, disinfection robots automatically  record the operation parameters of the disinfection process and by this, can provide efficiency and effectiveness assurance. Advantages of these robots also include but aren’t limited to : disinfection will work in an unmanned manner, without the need for ongoing human presence at the disinfection site. Therefore, exposure of health care workers to harmful UV radiation can be largely avoided during the process.Applying UV-C as a final disinfection step after manual disinfection provides an additional hygiene benefit to reducing cross-transmission and associated infections which I mentioned above. UV light does not leave any residues, making this an environmentally friendly disinfection method. However with every innovation comes limitations (My own quote, might’ve taken some inspiration from the spider man quote “With great power, comes great responsibility”). Limitations that I think this project would have is the need for some sort of pre-cleaning for the program to fully work during the initial launch and also length of time and affect to safety regulations.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>		
			<p>
			1)FPV Camera
                        Small light and cheap camera to send real time footage

                        2)FPV Video transmitter
                        Transmit video from your drone to your video receiver

                        3)FPV Video receiver
                        These pickup radio signals from video transmitters

                        4)Color Monitor
                        Uses the video receiver as a format to display the footage on a small coloured monitor

                        5)Radio controller
                        We should all know this by now unless you have never been fortunate to receiver or buy an rc car or helicopter (Remember those broke in day after hitting the roof)

                        6)Dual motors
                        One motor drives the back wheels and one for the front, pretty self explanatory

                        7)Gears
                        Used to transmit rotary motion from one shaft to another (If you don't understand, try and think of a manual car)

                        8)Blueprints of medical clinics/hospitals

                        9)Potentially drills
                        Everyone loves drills, especially when you accidentally drill a hole in yourself (No not what i meant, i mean drill yourself)

                        10) 3 Aspects required to build- Ground vehicle, UV Light tower, ground station controller</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required for this project are also pretty self explanatory. We definitely need some basic math & science for the measurement of various aspects and also error prevention. We also need basic building and sort of engineering skills, furthermore we should be well aware of how to work drills. For this project we definitely need C,C++ and Python while I try to figure out what else we need. Not 100%, but we may require basic A.I and M.L system understanding. </p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Business Aspect</h2>
					<p>If you’ve read all of the above, you might be thinking how innovative this is. Well my business model is simple, instead of making obnoxiously sized and pricey robots, I would rather be making miniature models of the same project for a less costly price. Therefore money input towards the project < total profit. So for example instead of a hospital purchasing a large machine to clean up a smaller surface area, they could purchase 2 maybe 3 of my smaller models to clean up the room which would not only be effective but also efficient for both me to make money and the hospital to save money. Research suggests that the production cost of each robot without labor could easily cost $50+ per robot. Now if I were to produce one that's ⅓ of the size of an obnoxious one, you would estimate that my production cost would be around $15. Now those companies making their robots for $50+ are selling their product for around $600, which hospitals are hesitant to buy as man power per hour is cheaper. However the aspect most hospitals don’t realize is that the purchase of a robot is permanent whereas staff changes require more or less depending. If I were to turn this idea into a business, I'd potentially look to profit at least $75 per robot, meaning selling the robot that cost me $15 for $100. Now think to yourself, would companies buy 1 large robot for $600+ or 1 for $100 and add on as many as they want based on their demands. Not only this but this would speed up the process by around 50% as there could be robots working in multiple rooms at a time.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, one downgrade would be that some cleaners would lose their job however this would be less impactful than a patient losing their life to the mistakes of that same cleaner. The success of this project would mean a tough competition for its competitors such as VIOMI or HOBOT. The original problem would be solved as according to google and various other sites, successful UVC robots have been proven to have a 99% success rate. This development would basically mean less deaths or illness because of involuntary actions and a way for us to pave our way into the future. This technology could also give birth to more innovative ideas that would be useful for the sustainability of this planet.</p>
